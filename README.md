==========

> Extract a 16 color palette from an image.

## The plan

- Use HUSL to compare colors
- Find:
    - Background
    - Foreground
    - 7 colors 
- Generate bold colors by brightening the 7 colors

## Goals

Be able to run in the browser so we can use it in terminal.sexy.

(Uploading to a server doesn't count).
